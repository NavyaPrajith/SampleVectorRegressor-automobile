This project focuses on predicting automobile prices using **Support Vector Regression (SVR) and GridSearch**, a technique for hyperparameter tuning. The dataset used contains various features related to automobiles, including attributes such as make, fuel type, horsepower, and more.

The primary objective is to develop a reliable regression model using SVR to accurately estimate automobile prices based on the provided features. GridSearch is employed to systematically search through a range of hyperparameters to find the optimal configuration for the SVR model, enhancing its predictive performance.

By leveraging these techniques, the project provides a powerful framework for accurately estimating automobile prices based on various attributes, thereby aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions in the automotive industry.
